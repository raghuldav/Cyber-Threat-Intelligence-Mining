# Cyber Threat Intelligence Mining for Organizational Cybersecurity Resilience

## Overview
The rapid evolution of digital technologies has significantly increased both the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks. Traditional cybersecurity solutions are often limited to identifying whether an attack has occurred, without providing deeper insights into the **nature or category of the attack**.

This project focuses on **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Mining** using **Machine Learning and Data Science** techniques to analyze historical cybersecurity data, extract meaningful intelligence, and proactively classify cyber threats. The system is designed not only to detect malicious activity but also to **identify the specific type of cyberattack**, enabling organizations to take faster and more informed defensive actions.

## Project Description
Cyber threat data is collected from multiple sources, including network logs, endpoint systems, and threat intelligence feeds. The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, noise removal, and feature standardization to ensure high-quality inputs for model training.

Several supervised machine learning models were implemented and evaluated, including **Random Forest**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Logistic Regression**. These models were trained on labeled datasets to learn historical attack patterns and predict future threats.

Among the evaluated models:
- **Random Forest** achieved an accuracy of **99.99%**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** achieved an accuracy of **97%**

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning-based CTI mining in enhancing cybersecurity resilience.
