# CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE MINING FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CYBERSECURITY RESILIENCE

## CTI Mining Using Machine Learning and Data Science

## Description
With the rapid advancement of technology, the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks have increased significantly. Traditional cybersecurity systems mainly focus on identifying whether an attack has occurred, but often fail to determine the **type of attack** or provide actionable intelligence.

This project applies **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) mining** combined with **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to extract meaningful insights from existing cybersecurity data and proactively identify potential threats. The goal is not only to detect attacks but also to **classify the specific attack type**, enabling organizations to respond more effectively.

Data is collected from multiple sources such as network logs, endpoint systems, and threat intelligence feeds. The data is then preprocessed to remove noise, handle inconsistencies, and standardize formats, ensuring high-quality inputs for model training.

Supervised machine learning models including **Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression** were trained on labeled datasets to identify attack patterns based on historical behavior. The **Random Forest model achieved 99.99% accuracy**, while the **KNN model achieved 97% accuracy**, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

Unlike conventional systems, this project identifies and classifies the following cyberattack types:
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Phishing
- Ransomware
- SQL Injection
- Spyware
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
